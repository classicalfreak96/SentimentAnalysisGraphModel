# Sentiment Analysis Via Graph Model from Texts

	For our project, we decided to work on a sentiment analysis model. In today’s social-media focused world, automated sentiment analysis on blogs, tweets, and other types of social platform media becomes increasingly important for public figures, political campaigns, and for a slew of other uses.
  
  
	Although there are many existing methods to perform sentiment analysis, one area which is not as explored is graph mining- thus, we chose to use graph mining to attempt sentiment analysis. We used a dataset consisting of 1.6 million tweets, which were pre-classified into positive and negative tweets. Although the dataset we sourced these tweets from claimed that the tweets were separated into three classes- positive, negative, and neutral, we did not find any tweets that were classified as neutral. We constructed different graph models that are representative of positive tweets, as well as another set of graph models representative of negative tweets. We also generated graph models of individual tweets to train several different classifiers by using different similarity measures to generate vectors representative of each tweet’s graph model. This will be discussed in further detail later.
